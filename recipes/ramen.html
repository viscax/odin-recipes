        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Doobydobap is one of my most favorite YouTubers today! She makes aesthetic food content videos 
            that really spark inspiration into my own cooking. She is usually found vlogging in Seoul, South Korea 
            and other cool places that she visits. She gives us a peek into her everyday life as a food content-creator 
            and I personally love her content. In fact, I watched her vlog "a wedding" this morning (it was a great watch!). 
            Anyways, she posted a YouTube video teaching her followers how to make Chili Oil Ramen from Shin Instant Ramen. 
            I decided to give it a try yesterday and I was pretty impressed on how it turned out. Let's get into it!

        <h3>Here's my attempt at it (definitely not as aesthetically pleasing lol):</h3>
