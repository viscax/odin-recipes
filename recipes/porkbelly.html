        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p class="text">
            As a kid, I would often be left in awe at the incredible smells
            emnating out of my kitchen. My mom has devoted herself to cooking the tastiest <em>Chinese-Style </em> 
            meals from recipes passed down from generation to generation. Now, I will proudly carry on this tradition
            of crafting tasty, traditional meals. This recipe of mine will teach you how to make Chinese-Style 
            Braised Pork belly (aka <em>Hong Shao Rou</em> in Chinese). A lengthy simmer of the porkbelly in delicious 
            soy-sauce based soup will leave you speechless! Served with green beans immersed in the soup and on rice, 
            Chinese-Style Braised Porkbelly is an easy recipe that won't fail to make your mouth water.

        <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb porkbelly</li>
                <li>1 lb of skin-on pork belly</li>
                <li>1 tablespoons oil</li>
                <li>1-2 tablespoon rock sugar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons Shaoxing Cooking Wine</li>
                <li>2-3 cups water</li>
                <li>1/2 ginger root (peeled/cut)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2-1 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>1-2 scallions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and chop the pork belly into 3/4 inch cubes.</li>
                <li>In the wok, boil enough water such that the pork belly can be fully submerged. 
                    Add some 1 tablespoon of the Shao Xing Cooking Wine into the water and 
                    blanch the pork in the water for upwards to 2 and a half minutes or so.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the pork and discard the boiled water.</li>
                <li>In the same wok on medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and rock sugar. Once the oil is hot enough, 
                    place the pork belly in the wok and cook until it reaches a slightly golden color. </li>
                <li>
                    Add water, soy sauce(s), chopped scallion, and Cooking Wine into the wok on high heat. Mix well and allow 
                    contents to boil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook the pork belly on a simmer for 60-75 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After this, if you see that the water hasn't boiled away that much, its okay. Turn the heat to medium-high 
                    and begin to boil off the water. This way, we can turn it into a delicious sauce. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    At this stage, I typically add some green beans or even tofu into the wok. These ingredients will 
                    absorb the tasty flavors that came from the pork belly.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    When you see that the water has mostly boiled away and you are left with a delicious looking glazed sauce,
                    the pork is ready to be served.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve with some steamed rice and enjoy!
                </li>

            </ol>
