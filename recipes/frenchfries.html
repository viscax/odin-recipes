        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p class="text">It's pretty safe to say that growing up, every kid enjoyed eating some delicious (but 
            pretty unhealthy) McDonald's French Fries. While I am definitely in the same boat, 
            I'd always feel guilty going to McDonald's. The well established social frame that McDonald's is junk food 
            and everything there is terrible for you sort of drove me away from those childhood pleasures. 
            Now, I compensate for that by making healthier, air-friend French Fries. This alternative uses very little oil and 
            is actually really easy to make. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <p class="text">Note: <em>1 Large Potato makes 2 servings</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Large Russet Potato</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>

        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Wash 1 large russet potato. With skin-on, cut the potato into desired french fry shape.
                (You get to customize the shape of your fries!).
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, add oil, salt, and pepper. Mix the contents evenly and well.
            </li>
            <li>
                In 2 batches, place the fries evenly on the air-fryer rack. Cook for 12 minutes at 375 F, 
                making sure to flip the fries at the half-way point.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the fries with ketchup and enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
